**Browse this selection of exercises to learn HTML and CSS Basics**

All exercises present real mockup html pages. This is practical for learning. 

***HOW TO***
- Click on the folder with the exercise to access its files
- You can copy the folder to your code editor (e.g. VSCode) to study the code
- Use 'Live Preview' in your editor to display html files in browser 

***NOTE***
- Often, my CSS files contain the hidden styling sections for practice. You can uncomment them to see how certain styling properties affect the display/styles of the elements. This allows you to understand dependencies between certain styling properties and how they affect the code.
