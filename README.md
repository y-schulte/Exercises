This repository stores real mockup html pages that I have built during my training for learning purposes. 

***HOW TO***
- Click on the folder with the exercise to access its files
- You can copy the folder to your preferred editor (e.g. VSCode) to study the code
- Use 'Live Preview' in your editor to display html files in your browser 

***NOTE***
- Often, my CSS files contain the hidden styling sections for practice. You can uncomment them to see how certain styling properties affect the display/styles of the elements. This allows you to understand dependencies between certain styling properties and how they affect the code. 

*If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.*
